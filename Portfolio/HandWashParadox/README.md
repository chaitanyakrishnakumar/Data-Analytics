# üßº The Handwashing Paradox  
This is a self-driven project where I revisited a famous historical medical case ‚Äî Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis‚Äô discovery that handwashing drastically reduced maternal deaths in the 1840s.  
My goal wasn‚Äôt just to retell history, but to practice **end-to-end data analysis**: from wrangling raw data, to SQL queries and statistical testing, all the way to visual storytelling.  

## üîé What I Worked On  
- **Data wrangling & cleaning:** loading annual/monthly hospital records, calculating mortality rates.  
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** comparing clinics, visualizing trends, and marking interventions.  
- **SQL integration:** writing queries inside Python to calculate totals and compare before/after periods.  
- **Statistical testing:** running a two-sample T-test to check if mortality reduction was significant.  
- **Visualization & storytelling:** creating clear charts (line plots, annotated turning points, bar charts) and tying them together in a notebook narrative.  

## üìö What I Learned  
- How to structure a data project from start to finish (not just isolated code snippets).  
- How EDA, SQL, and hypothesis testing can complement each other.  
- The value of framing results in a **story** ‚Äî it makes the analysis more memorable than just numbers.  
- That even a **historical dataset** can be used to show modern skills like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools used
- **Python** pandas, matplotlib, scipy, sqlite3  
- **Google Colab** (development & visualization)  
- **GitHub** (version control & sharing)  
- **Google Drive** (data storage & access)  
- **Markdown** (project documentation)  

## More Intresting stuff..

as we saw this guy ‚òùüèº Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that simple handwashing could drastically reduce maternal deaths from childbed fever in 1840's where no concept of germs & stuff... Despite his revolutionary discovery, his colleagues rejected his idea, and he was ridiculed and even committed to a mental asylum.

Ironically, what was once dismissed as madness is now celebrated as one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history. Today, Semmelweis is remembered as the father of infection control.<br>
