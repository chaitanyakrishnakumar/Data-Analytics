# ✨ Data Analytics Portfolio

🌊Python, 🪨Sheets, 🔥SQL, and 💨Visualization. Long ago, the 4 elements shaped Data with clarity.
Then, everything changed when data got chaotic. Only the **Data Avatar**, master of all 4 elements, could bring balance and insight.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To become the next Data Avatar, though having great motivation and curiosity, I still have much to learn like SQL, Sheets, Python... before tackling real world data analysis.
<br>
In this repository, I showcase projects I’ve built while exploring Data Analytics, capturing my learnings from the basics to mastering the four elements.<br>

## 🏆 Portfolio Projects
- [The HandWash Paradox](https://github.com/chaitanyakrishnakumar/Data-Analytics/tree/main/Portfolio/HandWashParadox) Used historical medical data, explored statistics, visualized patterns, and validated Dr. Semmelweis’ work through data analysis and documentation.
- [Workout Logger](https://github.com/chaitanyakrishnakumar/Data-Analytics/tree/main/Portfolio/Workout%20Logger) Collected personal workout data, used natural language API, Automated data logging into Sheets, processed data using Pandas and derived real-world usable insights.

## 🌱 Python Projects
- [IndianStatesGame](https://github.com/chaitanyakrishnakumar/Data-Analytics/tree/main/Python/IndianStatesGame) Built a geography quiz using Pandas and CSV data, letting users identify Indian states on a blank map while practicing data handling and analysis.
- [Slang Decoder](https://github.com/chaitanyakrishnakumar/Data-Analytics/tree/main/Python/SlangDecode) Created a tool that reads unknown acronyms from CSV using Pandas and returns their full forms, practicing basic data manipulation and lookup.
