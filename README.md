# ‚ú® Data Analytics Portfolio

Python, Sheets, SQL, and Visualization. Long ago, the four elements shaped Data with clarity.
<br>
Then, everything changed when data got chaotic. Only the **Data Avatar**, master of all four elements, could bring balance and insight.
<br>
I began my journey to become the next Data Avatar. Although I have great motivation and curiosity, I have a lot to learn like SQL, Sheets, Python‚Ä¶ before bending data and its secrets.<br>
In this repository, I showcase projects I‚Äôve built while exploring Data Analytics, capturing my learnings from the basics to mastering the four elements.<br>
