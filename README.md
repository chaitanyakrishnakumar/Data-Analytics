# ✨ Data Analytics Portfolio

Python, Sheets, SQL, and Visualization. Long ago, the four elements shaped Data with clarity.<br>
Then, everything changed when data got chaotic. Only the **Data Avatar**, master of all four elements, could bring balance and insight.<br>

I began my journey to become the next Data Avatar. Although I have great motivation and curiosity, I have a lot to learn like SQL, Sheets, Python… before bending data and its secrets.<br>

In this repository, I showcase projects I’ve built while exploring Data Analytics, capturing my learnings from the basics to mastering the four elements.
